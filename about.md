Some information about you!

### More Information

Hello and welcome! I am a 2001 graduate of Colby Community College's Veterinary Technology program. In my years as a registered vet tech I worked in small private practices, zoos and finally my state's veterinary teaching hospital. Throughout my career, the one constant was the satisfaction I felt helping owners (and later vet students) understand complicated concepts so they could better care for their pets. At the vet school I got to write the copy for the Cardiology department's website. I also created educational materials for our students. 

When I moved on to coding, I found that much of the documentation I was trying to learn from was unclear for a beginner like me. So I wrote my own and shared it with my colleagues. I love coding, but I will admit it doesn't come naturally to me. When I was on the bench I was put on a project where my team wrote educational materials for people just breaking into tech. I had always succeeded in my projects, but when my writing was held up to the team as the standard I knew I wanted more. Then I looked into it and discovered that this kind of writing is a whole career in and of itself!

So here I am. Currently I am doing manual and automated testing but I am working on building skills and a portfolio so I can confidently move into technical writing. 

I hope that this blog will be a welcoming place for everyone. My goal is that it will help others who want to change their careers, whether it's to make more money or just find a better fit. So if that's you or if you're just curious, again I say welcome!
