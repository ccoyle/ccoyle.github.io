### Giving Jekyll a shot

I'm working my way through the excellent course on writing API docs at [I'd Rather Be Writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/). Activity 1a is all about pinpointing what our individual goals are and why exactly we are going to absorb 146 (web) pages of information. The author suggests a blog post and I'd read elsewhere (r/technicalwriting maybe?) that Jekyll is a good tool to learn. So here we are! As we go along my intent is to provide more context about my background and get information out there that will be helpful to career changers like me. However, right now I have an assigment to finish, so let's get to it!

+ Why are you taking this course?
  - I am taking this course because I read advice on r/technicalwriting that being able to write API docs is a good skill to have and the I'd Rather Be Writing course is a good way to acquire it. 
+ What are your career ambitions related to API documentation?
  - As someone changing careers from test automation engineer to technical writer, I want to start my job search in a position of strength. My career ambition is to land a job in a supportive company where I can take my experience with testing code (including testing APIs) and my love of writing helpful documentation and turn them into solid technical writing career. 
+ Are you in a place where developer documentation jobs are plentiful?
  - No. I am in a small city in Kansas, 2 hours from Kansas City. No technical jobs are plentiful here. I will be relying on my ability to find a job working remotely. In my current position I have been working remotely from an office (our cients were locate elsewhere) and then from home successfully. 
+ What would you consider a successful metric for this course?
  - I would consider this course successful if by the end I have a portfolio showing my skills in API documentation. Less concretely, I will consider it successful if I can go into interviews feeling confident in my ability to write API docs.
+ Do you have the technical mindset needed to excel in developer documentation fields?
  - Yes, I believe so. Testing code, including API requires a solid understanding of how it works. I love tech and I love learning about how everything works. I don't believe that curiosity will ever go away. I'm not moving into technical writing because I hate coding. I'm doing it because I love explaining it clearly to others.
