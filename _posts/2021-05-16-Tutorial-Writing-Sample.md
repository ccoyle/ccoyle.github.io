### Introduction  
When I decided I wanted to practice writing a tutorial, selecting a topic was my first and perhaps most difficult challenge. I considered everything from getting your dog to take medication to writing a tutorial about how to write a tutorial! In the end I took inspiration from a recent real-world example. My Mom needed to email a video that was too large for her email and messaging apps from her phone. In the end I did it for her, but if I has written her a tutorial it would have looked something like this.
